# Notes

## Lekaeia

Xiao Lion, Xiao Black Bear and Arcty in game? Not as Player Characters. Part of the lore/important NPCs.

Some kind of duality? (Persona 5) But lucky number 3 (triple parallel worlds?)

Form of government: feudalism? oligarchy? parliamentary?

## Things to incorporate

- Xiao Lion's tail (MAGIC!)
- Electric bazooka
- Magic bowl and disneyland &rarr; great migration
- IT trains & disneytech
- Fast food chains: McChicken, McBurger, Shark fins, Thomas's food truck
- West fighting paw, east eating paw, central heart, south tail, north head
- Xiao Lion's backyard, Maple grove
- Mt. Blue, Sunset Mountain
- Other NPCs: Small dog, Big brown bear (RIP)

## Ideas

PC is called 'Main Character', Xiao Lion called 'Big Real Lion', etc. &rarr; NPCs named after their descriptions.
Only way to get rid of the evil is to leave. To beat the game you have to leave the game.
